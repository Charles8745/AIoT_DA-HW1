## Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture Choices
- **Framework**: Streamlit for rapid web UI development with Python integration
- **ML Library**: scikit-learn for simplicity, reliability, and educational clarity
- **Data Handling**: pandas for structured data management and manipulation
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive, professional-grade charts with hover effects and zoom capabilities
- **Styling Approach**: Custom CSS with Glassmorphism design philosophy for modern aesthetic

### Design Philosophy Evolution
- **Phase 1**: Basic Apple-inspired clean design with minimal interaction
- **Phase 2**: Enhanced gradients and interactive elements with comprehensive features
- **Phase 3**: True Glassmorphism with desktop-first responsive design and sidebar organization
- **UI/UX Principles**: Progressive disclosure, immediate feedback, visual hierarchy, accessibility-focused

### Performance & Scalability Decisions
- **Desktop-First**: Optimized for computer landscape viewing with wide layout support
- **Conditional Rendering**: Optional components (residuals, true line) to reduce computational overhead
- **Real-time Updates**: Efficient state management with Streamlit's session state for parameter persistence
- **Glass Effect Implementation**: CSS backdrop-filter with performance-optimized transparency layers

### Deployment Strategy
- **Local Development**: Standard Python virtual environment setup
- **Cloud Deployment**: Streamlit Community Cloud for free public access
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive, beginner-friendly guides

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Achieving True Glassmorphism Effect
- **Issue**: Standard Streamlit components don't support advanced CSS effects like backdrop-filter
- **Solution**: Implemented custom CSS with rgba transparency, backdrop-filter blur, and layered glass effects
- **Result**: Authentic Glassmorphism aesthetic with consistent transparency hierarchy

### Challenge: Desktop-Responsive Design
- **Issue**: Streamlit's default mobile-first approach not optimal for data visualization dashboards
- **Solution**: Custom CSS media queries, wide layout configuration, and sidebar-based responsive design
- **Result**: Optimized experience for landscape desktop viewing

### Challenge: Real-time Interactive Performance
- **Issue**: Complex calculations and chart rendering could cause lag during parameter changes
- **Solution**: Efficient state management, conditional rendering, and Plotly's optimized update mechanisms
- **Result**: Smooth, responsive user experience with instant visual feedback

### Challenge: Code Organization & Maintainability
- **Issue**: Growing complexity of UI components and interactions
- **Solution**: Modular function structure, clear separation of concerns, comprehensive documentation
- **Result**: Maintainable, scalable codebase with clear technical documentation

### Challenge: Visual Hierarchy & User Experience
- **Issue**: Balancing feature richness with interface simplicity
- **Solution**: Progressive disclosure through sidebar organization, conditional component rendering
- **Result**: Clean main interface with advanced features accessible but not overwhelming
